Ensure that you have the OpenStack command-line client installed and configured before proceeding.</p> <p>Step 1: Source the OpenStack RC File Before using the CLI, source the OpenStack RC file to set environment variables:</p> <pre><code>source &lt;your-openstack-rc-file&gt;\nReplace &lt;your-openstack-rc-file&gt; with the path to your OpenStack RC file.\n</code></pre> <p>Step 2: List Available Images, Flavors, and Networks To list available images, flavors, and networks, use the following commands:</p> <p><pre><code>openstack image list\nopenstack flavor list\nopenstack network list\n</code></pre> Note the IDs or names of the image, flavor, and network you want to use for your instance.</p> <p>Step 3: Launch an Instance Use the openstack server create command to launch an instance:</p> <pre><code>openstack server create --flavor &lt;flavor&gt; --image &lt;image&gt; --nic net-id=&lt;network&gt; --key-name &lt;keypair&gt; &lt;instance-name&gt; \n</code></pre> <p>Replace , , , , and  with the appropriate values.  For example: <p><pre><code>openstack server create --flavor m1.small --image cirros --nic net-id=my_network --key-name my_keypair my_instance\n</code></pre> Step 4: Associate Floating IP to Instance Allocate a floating IP from the floating IP pool:</p> <p><pre><code>openstack floating ip create &lt;floating-ip-pool&gt;\n</code></pre> Associate the floating IP with your instance:</p> <p><pre><code>openstack server add floating ip &lt;instance-name&gt; &lt;floating-ip-address&gt;\n</code></pre> Replace , , and  accordingly. <p>Congratulations! You have successfully launched an instance in OpenStack using the CLI.
