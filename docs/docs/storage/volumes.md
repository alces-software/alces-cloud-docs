#Volumes
A volume acts as the virtual hard drive for your instances. All instances are required to be booted from a volume and additional volumes can be attached to your instances if you require additional disks.

## Create and Attach
Volume creation is useful for attaching a second data volume to your instance.

### Create
1. On the Alces Cloud dashboard, navigate to `Volume` and then `Volumes` on the left side menu.
2. Click the `Create Volume` button.
3. Enter a volume name and size.
4. Click create volume.

### Attach
1. On the Alces Cloud dashboard, navigate to `Volume` and then `Volumes` on the left side menu.
2. On the action dropdown menu for your volume, click `Manage Attachments`.
3. Select the instance to attach the volume to, and then press `Attach Volume`.

Once you have attached your volume, login to your instance to format and mount the volume as required.
